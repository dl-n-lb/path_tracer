# A Path Tracer explored fully for my own learning
This project contains full(ish) explanations for every section, with the hope that I can learn more about how path tracers work by working on it. It is designed to be a good testing ground for new techniques as I learn, so will probably never be hardcore optimised.

## Docs
Documentation is written in org-mode.
